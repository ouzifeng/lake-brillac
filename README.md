Lake Brillac Fishing Site

Super basic single page HTML website built for a friend who owns a fishing lake in France and needed something simple for anglers to find and get in touch with them

This was designed to their requirement - it is a bit basic for me, but beauty is subjective I suppose

I have removed their PHP settings for the contact form for obvious security reasons. You will have to fill those in yourself

It is made using Bootstrap so is fully responsive. Feel free to clone and edit yourself as I didn't charge for doing this
